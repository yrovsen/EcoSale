          Waste reduction, also known as waste minimization or waste prevention, refers to the process of reducing the amount of waste generated and promoting sustainable practices to minimize environmental impact. It involves adopting strategies and implementing measures to minimize waste generation at its source, maximize resource efficiency, and promote recycling and reuse.
          
          Here are some key aspects and strategies related to waste reduction:
          
          Source Reduction: Source reduction focuses on preventing waste generation in the first place. This includes practices such as designing products with less packaging, promoting durable and reusable products, and encouraging the use of digital documents instead of printed materials.
          
          Recycling and Composting: Recycling involves collecting and processing materials such as paper, plastics, glass, and metals to create new products. Composting involves the decomposition of organic waste, such as food scraps and yard trimmings,
